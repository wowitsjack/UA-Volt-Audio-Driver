# Open Extraction of UA Volt Driver Software

## Introduction
Welcome to the Open Extraction of UA Volt Driver Software repository. This project was created to offer a streamlined and accessible approach to installing the UA Volt driver, especially for users who face challenges with the standard installation process. Our aim is to simplify the installation, making it more user-friendly and inclusive.

## Why This Project Exists
- **Offline Installation**: Recognizing the need for an offline installation method for environments where internet access is limited or non-existent.
- **No Account Requirement**: We understand the inconvenience and privacy concerns associated with mandatory account creation. This project eliminates the need for an account, ensuring privacy and ease of access.
- **No Need For iLok/PACE**: Traditional installation methods require iLok/PACE, which can be cumbersome for some users or clash with existing drivers. This project provides a solution that eliminates these requirements, making the installation process more straightforward.
- **True GDPR Compliance**: Several UA products violate the GDPR currently by requring the collection of personal data for a purchased service, or function. This solution allows users to proceed with using their purchased product and allows UA to avoid potential litigation.

## Features
- **Complete Binary Package**: The software is packaged as a complete binary, ensuring that all necessary components are included for a successful installation.
- **Ease of Use**: Designed with simplicity in mind, the installation process is straightforward - download, unzip, and run.
